# Diabetes-Disease-Prediction
Project Summary: Diabetes Prediction
This project uses machine learning to predict diabetes based on health indicators. Key technologies include Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy, and Scikit-learn.

Steps Involved:

Data Loading and Exploration: Understand the dataset and identify missing values.
Data Cleaning: Correct data entries and encode categorical variables.
Statistical Analysis: Perform chi-square and Pearson correlation tests.
Data Visualization: Create histograms, bar charts, and box plots.
Data Preprocessing: Normalize features, generate polynomial features, and select key features.
Outlier Detection and Removal: Use nearest neighbors to identify and remove outliers.
Model Training and Evaluation: Train multiple machine learning models and evaluate their performance using metrics like recall, precision, accuracy, F1-score, and ROC AUC.

Outputs:
Visualizations of data distributions and relationships.
Results of statistical tests.
Preprocessed and cleaned data.
Model performance metrics to assess predictive accuracy.
The project provides a comprehensive approach to predicting diabetes, leveraging data science techniques for effective analysis and model building.
